# Background

> “If I could buy my freedom, I would.” — Phillip, lawsuit plaintiff

In 2022, people jailed after an arrest because they could not buy release with money bail sued Los Angeles County and City for discrimination and jailing on the basis of wealth. Represented by Civil Rights Corps and Public Justice, people jailed won a preliminary injunction requiring release for an expanded group of arrestees. 

You can learn more about the case here: [Case Materials](https://www.publicjustice.net/case_brief/urquidi-v-city-of-los-angeles/)

As a part of the case, people jailed also won access to daily monitoring reports of arrests and custody status in Los Angeles County to monitor compliance with the Preliminary Injunction and any final ruling. To protect the identity of arrested people, this data can only be shared after being anonymized. 

This project anonymizes daily reports before sharing the data with approved external analysts.
